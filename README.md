# ðŸŒ± My Garden â€“ Productivity To-Do App

**My Garden** is a personal productivity web application that combines task management with a visual, motivational experience. As users complete their tasks, a virtual garden grows and becomes more beautiful â€” encouraging focus and consistency in a gentle and creative way.

## Main Features

- Task creation with priority and due date
- View list of pending tasks
- Progress bar showing percentage of completed tasks
- Concept of a growing garden that evolves based on user productivity
- Visual placeholder for a calendar view and motivational garden widget
- Sorting options by priority, due date, or both

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Java with Spring Boot
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Database**: MySQL
- **JPA** used for object-relational mapping and data handling

## Current State

The backend is structured with models, services, repositories and controllers, and includes user/task management with relational mapping.  
The frontend has the main layout and some UI views designed and partially integrated. The garden visual and calendar view are outlined but not fully implemented.

##  Future Improvements

- Garden animation logic based on completed tasks
- Calendar view with tasks by date
- User authentication and session management
- Responsive design and frontend polish
- Full integration between frontend and backend

## Notes

This is a personal project built for learning and practice. While it's currently not complete, it helped structure a real-world full-stack application using Spring Boot and web technologies.
